      <h2>What is Docker</h2> 
      <p>.Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow developers to package applications with all parts it needs and ship it all out as one package. Runs on any other linux machine no matter the customized settings the machine has that is different from the machine used to write and test the code- https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker.</p>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINIX is an open source software for serving, reverse proxying, caching,load balancing, media streaming and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers. -https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/.</p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. In other words, creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself. The virtual machine is sandboxed from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a virtual machine can’t escape or tamper with the computer itself. This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they weren’t originally intended for. -https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-virtual-machine/.</p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a cloud computing vendor that offers an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform for software developers. DigitalOcean is very popular with open source developers and competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Compute Engine. To deploy DigitalOcean's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment, developers launch a private virtual machine (VM) instance, which DigitalOcean calls a "droplet." Developers choose the droplet's size, which geographical region and data center it will run in, and which Linux operating system it will use: Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, CoreOS or FreeBSD. Secure Shell (SSH) is also supported for secure communication. Instead of picking a Linux distribution, developers can also create droplets from existing VM images that come with pre-installed applications -- an option DigitalOcean calls "One-click Apps". -https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/DigitalOcean.</p>
