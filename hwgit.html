      <h2>What is GIT?</h2> 
      <p>"Git is a actively maintained open source project that was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, who also created the Linux operating system kernel. Lots of commercial projects as well as open source use and rely on git for version control". -https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git.</p>

      <h2>Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Version control protects the source code from both catastrophe as well as human error issues. It also trackes every individual change by each contributor and can help prevent concurrent work from conflicting. -https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control.</p>

      <h2>Describe following terms: </h2>
      <p>Local Repo: the purpose of a local repo is to make changes to code that you save onto your computer where you can then push onto your remote repository.</p>

      <p>Remote Repo: Centralized place where all changes go that you made in the local repo. To keep track of all code that was created.</p>

      <h2>How to use GIT in Team Project.</h2>
      <p>GIT allows an entire team to work on the same repository at the same time. Different features can be worked on with using branches that are merged to the main branch when complete, and changes made by multiple team members to the same location can be manually merged to ensure work is not automatically overwritten.</p>
